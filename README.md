# Lexical_Analyzer_Oberon
This is an implementation of lexical analyzer for the simple Oberon version (not Oberon-2 or Oberon-7, just Oberon).
The code was writen using Java 8 and IntelliJ Idea IDE by Jet Brains.
To compile and run our code of the Oberon lexer use IntelliJ Idea. This SDK is free that is why you can use it. In root directory there are in.txt and out.txt files that are used as input and output.
Launcher.java is the main class of our application.
